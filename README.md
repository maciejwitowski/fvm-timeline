This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Build

You have two options when it comes to building your project.

### Using Node.js

Next.js assumes you want to deploy your project onto a site with Node.js installed. If this is the case, run `npm run build` to build your site:

```shell
npm run build
```

This command will output your project into the `.next` directory. You can find out [more information on Deployment at the Next.js docs site](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

### Static site

If you want a static site that you can host anywhere, use `npm run build-static`:

```shell
npm run build-static
```

This command will output your project to the `out` folder. You can move this folder to a static site hosting service such as Fleek or Netlify.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
